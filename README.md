## Chilled Theme
The Chilled Theme is derived from ChillThemes

## Non-responsive option
If your theme is not responsive set responsive to false in the products.js file and Switcheroo will hide the tablet and mobile buttons for that particular theme. In my demo above every other theme is set to responsive false.
